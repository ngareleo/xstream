# xstream

High-resolution web streaming with a full resolution ladder (240p → 4K). The server transcodes video files on demand using ffmpeg and streams fMP4 segments over HTTP. The client renders them using the browser's Media Source Extensions (MSE) API.

## Stack

- **Server:** Bun, graphql-yoga, SQLite (`bun:sqlite`), fluent-ffmpeg
- **Client:** React, Relay, Chakra UI, Vite, React Router

---

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.1+
- `ffmpeg` accessible via `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` (installed automatically as a dependency — no system ffmpeg required)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (required for Seq log management — optional for basic development)

---

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 2. Configure media libraries

Edit `mediaFiles.json` in the project root. Add entries for your local video directories:

```json
{
  "libraries": [
    {
      "name": "My Videos",
      "path": "/absolute/path/to/your/videos",
      "mediaType": "movies",
      "env": "dev"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `path` must be an absolute path to a directory containing video files (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.m4v`, `.webm`). Files can be nested in subdirectories.

### 3. Generate Relay artifacts

The client uses Relay for GraphQL queries. The compiler artifacts need to be generated before the client can build.

`server/schema.graphql` is committed to the repository and must be kept in sync with `server/src/graphql/schema.ts` manually whenever the schema changes. Once it is up to date, regenerate the client artifacts:

```bash
cd client
bun relay
cd ..
```

---

## Running in Development

Start both the server and client in parallel:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Or start them individually:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — server on :3001
cd server && bun run dev

# Terminal 2 — client on :5173
cd client && bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

The server scans your configured media libraries on startup. You should see your videos in the library view within a few seconds. Large libraries with many files will take longer to ffprobe.

---

## Using the App

1. Open the app — your media libraries are listed with all indexed videos
2. Click **Rescan Libraries** to pick up newly added files without restarting
3. Click a video to open the player
4. The player defaults to the highest resolution the source file supports
5. Use the resolution badges in the control bar to switch quality (240p → 4K)
6. The first play triggers a transcode job — playback begins after the first 1–2 segments are ready (~2–4 seconds)

## Observability

xstream uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for structured logs and distributed traces. In development, telemetry is routed to a local [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq) instance. Switching to a cloud backend (e.g. Axiom) in production requires only env var changes — no code changes.

### Local Seq setup

```bash
bun run seq:start
```

On first run this generates a random admin password and stores it in `.seq-credentials` (gitignored), then starts the Seq Docker container with that password. Open the file to find your login:

```bash
cat .seq-credentials
```

Then open [http://localhost:5341](http://localhost:5341) and sign in with `username=admin` and the generated password.

To stop Seq: `bun run seq:stop`

**Resetting Seq** (e.g. to rotate credentials or after a schema change):

```bash
bun run seq:stop
docker rm seq
rm .seq-credentials        # optional — deletes the old password
bun run seq:start          # generates a new password and fresh container
```

See [`docs/observability.md`](docs/observability.md) for the full telemetry architecture and instructions for switching to a production backend (Axiom, Grafana Cloud, etc.).

---

## Production

```bash
NODE_ENV=production \
  PORT=8080 \
  SEGMENT_DIR=/var/xstream/segments \
  DB_PATH=/var/xstream/xstream.db \
  bun run start
```

In production, set `env: "prod"` on your `mediaFiles.json` entries and point `SEGMENT_DIR` and `DB_PATH` to persistent storage (not `/tmp`).

---

## Development Notes

- The `tmp/` directory is gitignored. Delete it to reset all cached segments and the database.
- After any GraphQL schema change, re-run `bun relay` inside `client/` to regenerate Relay artifacts.
- Transcode jobs are cached by `(videoPath + resolution + timeRange)`. Re-requesting the same combination serves segments from the existing job immediately.
