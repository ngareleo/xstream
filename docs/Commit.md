# Architect Commit Log

Append-only log of doc updates made by the `architect` subagent. **Newest entry on top.** Each entry is terminated by a single line containing exactly three hyphens (a markdown horizontal rule) so `sed -n '1,/^---$/p' docs/Commit.md` returns just the latest one.

The architect reads the top entry on every invocation and compares its SHA to `git rev-parse HEAD`. If they differ, it scans the intervening commits and brings docs back in sync, then prepends a new entry. See [`.claude/agents/architect.md`](../.claude/agents/architect.md) → "Commit synchronisation" for the full protocol (first-run handling, `git merge-base` ancestry check, worktree handling, and the 20-commit cap on drift).

Entry shape (each entry ends with the divider line described above):

- `## <short-sha> — <YYYY-MM-DD>` heading
- `**Files:**` followed by a comma-separated list of doc paths touched (or "no doc updates needed" if a sync scan found nothing actionable)
- `**Why:**` followed by a one-line summary
- `**Source commits scanned:**` followed by a `<sha>..<sha>` range, included only when the entry was triggered by a sync scan rather than a same-session edit

**IMPORTANT for the preamble:** do not use bare `---` lines anywhere in this top-of-file block — `sed` would stop at the first one and miss real entries below. The first `---` line in this file MUST be the terminator of the most recent entry.

<!-- ENTRIES BELOW — newest first; each ends with a bare `---` line. The architect's next invocation will treat the no-entries state as the first-run case and prepend a bootstrap entry at HEAD. -->

## 427da30 — 2026-05-04 — Loading UX consolidation: remove overlay, keep play-button spinner (same-session curation)

**Files:** `docs/client/Components/VideoPlayer.md`, `docs/client/Components/ControlBar.md`
**Why:** Curator sync for feat/library-film-entity PR #59: UX feedback consolidated loading affordances. Removed full-area `loadingOverlay` (56×56 spinner on dimmed scrim), which duplicated and obscured the play-button icon morph. ControlBar's 20×20 spinner morph (green top arc, 0.75s spin) is now the sole loading signal, staying on-screen without mouse movement. Controls forced `visible: true` during loading so the morphed play button remains visible during stalls. Two doc files updated: VideoPlayer spec clarified that loading state has no separate overlay and documented control-visibility force; ControlBar spec expanded play-button behavior note to explain icon morphing as the in-place, modern affordance.

## 8941fcb — 2026-05-04 — Probe-cache: ffprobe result caching per video_id (same-session curation)

**Files:** `docs/server/Config/00-AppConfig.md`, `docs/architecture/Streaming/06-FfmpegPool.md`, `docs/architecture/Observability/server/00-Spans.md`
**Why:** Curator sync for feat/library-film-entity PR #59 (probe-cache slice): Seq trace 354eefb4… showed seek latency dominated by ~2.4 s ffmpeg cold-start; ~150–200 ms per chunk was a fresh ffprobe on the same source file. Within a session, the same file is ffprobed 5–10 times (ramp + each seek). Cache + lazy-fill per `video_id` eliminates ~1 s cumulative server work; per-seek win is ~150–200 ms. Three doc files updated: AppConfig (new AppContext §Probe cache subsection documenting keying, lazy fill, no-explicit-invalidation policy, miss-path error handling), Streaming/06-FfmpegPool (new paragraph in "Why a separate module" linking the two sibling caches), Observability server spans (transcode.job row expanded with probe performance note re cache hits/misses).

## 0dc8774 — 2026-05-04 — Seek-cancel latency reduction: serial-lookahead gate + pool cap 3→5 (same-session curation)

**Files:** `docs/server/GraphQL-Schema/00-Surface.md`, `docs/architecture/Streaming/01-Playback-Scenarios.md`, `docs/architecture/Streaming/02-Chunk-Pipeline-Invariants.md`, `docs/architecture/Streaming/06-FfmpegPool.md`, `docs/server/Config/00-AppConfig.md`, `docs/architecture/Observability/server/00-Spans.md`, `docs/architecture/Observability/client/00-Spans.md`
**Why:** Curator sync for feat/library-film-entity PR #59 (third slice): seek-latency optimization landed. Three coupled changes: (1) New `cancelTranscode(jobIds: [ID!]!): Boolean!` mutation + `KillReason::ClientCancel` variant. (2) Serial-lookahead-gate dual-check: prefetch fires only when prior lookahead completes OR timeUntilEnd ≤ 90 s (serial primary + RAF safety net). New invariant (#4): at most one lookahead in flight. Stale-update filtering prevents orphaned jobs from resetting gate. (3) Pool cap bumped 3 → 5 to accommodate rapid seek-cancel-respawn cycles. Updated seven doc files: GraphQL-Schema (cancelTranscode mutation added), Streaming/01-Playback-Scenarios (seek scenario §1 documents cancel-on-seek call before fetch abort), 02-Chunk-Pipeline-Invariants (new §4 invariant + interaction table updated), 06-FfmpegPool (cap formula + config table updated to 5, KillReason enum expanded with ClientCancel rationale, pool-cap discussion clarified), AppConfig (max_concurrent_jobs: 5 with rationale), Observability server/00-Spans (concurrency_cap_reached event attributes updated to cap 5, transcode_killed event documents client_cancel reason), Observability client/00-Spans (transcode.request row expanded with serial-gate note; pre-fix prefetch double-fire is now audit-able).

## f68ba91 — 2026-05-04 — TTFF reduction: page-mount prewarm + uniform startup buffer (same-session curation)

**Files:** `docs/SUMMARY.md`, `docs/client/Config/00-ClientConfig.md`, `docs/architecture/Streaming/00-Protocol.md`, `docs/architecture/Streaming/01-Playback-Scenarios.md`, `docs/client/Components/VideoPlayer.md`, `docs/architecture/Observability/client/00-Spans.md`
**Why:** Curator sync for feat/library-film-entity PR #59 (second slice): two TTFF-reduction changes landed. (1) Page-mount prewarm pattern: `VideoPlayer` fires `startTranscode(videoId, nativeMax, 0, 10)` on mount with errors swallowed; ffmpeg silently encodes chunk 0 while the user views the poster. Click-path cache-hits if resolution is unchanged; orphan-timeout (30 s) safety-kills unclaimed warmups. (2) Uniform startup buffer: `startupBufferS` is now 2 seconds for all resolutions (was per-resolution 2–6 s); the ramp's 10 s first chunk provides an 8 s safety margin. Updated six doc files: SUMMARY (streaming paragraph mentions prewarm + uniform buffer), ClientConfig (startupBufferS row changed to 2s with rationale), Streaming protocol (Startup Buffer section rewritten), Playback-Scenarios (prewarm phase section added, initial-playback flow updated, startupBufferS references changed), VideoPlayer spec (Mount-time prewarm subsection + safety invariants added), Observability client spans (transcode.request row documented with prewarm pattern note).

## 0071cfa — 2026-05-04 — OBS-STDERR-001: silent-failure detection + cascade (same-session curation)

**Files:** `docs/architecture/Observability/server/00-Spans.md`, `docs/server/Hardware-Acceleration/01-HDR-Pad-Artifact.md`, `docs/todo.md`
**Why:** Curator sync: OBS-STDERR-001 landed on feat/library-film-entity. Silent-failure detection (ffmpeg clean exit + zero segments) now triggers cascade fallback; per-tier `transcode_silent_failure` events carry `tier`, `ffmpeg_stderr` tail, `chunk_start_s`, `chunk_end_s` for Seq filterability; cascade exhaustion emits distinct `transcode_silent_failure_cascade_exhausted` event. HDR-Pad-Artifact §VAAPI rewritten: cascade is now the structural mitigation (no longer pending). OBS-STDERR-001 item removed from todo.md.

---

## f708e64 — 2026-05-04 — Chunk-duration ramp controller (same-session curation)

**Files:** `docs/SUMMARY.md`, `docs/architecture/Streaming/00-Protocol.md`, `docs/architecture/Streaming/01-Playback-Scenarios.md`, `docs/architecture/Streaming/02-Chunk-Pipeline-Invariants.md`, `docs/client/Config/00-ClientConfig.md`, `docs/client/Feature-Flags/00-Registry.md`, `docs/architecture/Observability/client/00-Spans.md`, `docs/server/Hardware-Acceleration/01-HDR-Pad-Artifact.md`, `docs/todo.md`
**Why:** Curator sync for feat/library-film-entity branch: ramp-controller PR (#59) landed a per-session chunk-duration ramp (`[10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60]` seconds, then 60 s steady-state), replacing the old fixed 300 s / 30 s two-tier model. Ramp resets at session start, every seek, MSE recovery, and resolution switch, so all anchor points enjoy fast cold-start parity. Removed VAAPI HDR workaround (the ramp reaches the bug surface; OBS-STDERR-001 is the escalation). Removed `flag.devForceShortChunkAtZero` (obsolete under ramp model). Updated nine doc files: SUMMARY (streaming paragraph), Streaming protocol & scenarios & invariants (chunk descriptions), ClientConfig (chunkRampS / chunkSteadyStateS replace chunkDurationS / firstChunkDurationS), Feature Flags (removed flag), Observability client spans (chunk.end_s replaces chunk.number), HDR-Pad-Artifact (ramp model section), todo.md (CHUNK-001 reframed for per-resolution calibration post-ramp).

## a7479d5 — 2026-05-03 — Show entity + profile availability + local poster cache (sync)

**Files:** `docs/architecture/Library-Scan/03-Show-Entity.md` (NEW), `docs/architecture/Library-Scan/04-Profile-Availability.md` (NEW), `docs/architecture/Library-Scan/05-Poster-Caching.md` (NEW), `docs/architecture/Library-Scan/README.md`, `docs/architecture/Observability/server/00-Spans.md`, `docs/server/DB-Schema/00-Tables.md`, `docs/server/GraphQL-Schema/00-Surface.md`, `docs/server/Config/00-AppConfig.md`, `docs/client/Components/ShowTile.md` (NEW), `docs/client/Components/ShowDetailsOverlay.md` (NEW), `docs/client/Components/README.md`, `docs/client/Components/Poster.md`, `docs/client/Components/ProfileRow.md`, `docs/client/Components/SeasonsPanel.md`, `docs/client/Components/FilmDetailsOverlay.md`, `docs/client/Components/PlayerContent.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/SUMMARY.md`, `docs/todo.md`
**Why:** Curator sync for feat/library-film-entity branch at HEAD a7479d5. PR #59 landed three layers on top of the Film entity: (1) Show entity (TV mirror, two dedup axes, drop of synthetic show-Video pattern); (2) profile availability probe (`libraries.status`/`last_seen_at`, scanner skip on offline); (3) local OMDb poster cache (`services::poster_cache` + `GET /poster/:basename` + `posterUrl` rewrite). Three new architecture docs, DB-Schema + GraphQL-Schema reconciled, two new component specs (ShowTile, ShowDetailsOverlay), Poster/ProfileRow/SeasonsPanel/FilmDetailsOverlay/PlayerContent updated for new fragment shapes, INDEX + SUMMARY refreshed, observability spans extended with `library.tv_discovery`, `library.availability_probe`, `poster_cache.poll`. 12 declared tech-debt items in `docs/todo.md` (5 for poster cache, 7 for Show entity / availability picker UI).

## (pending Film entity merge) — 2026-05-03 — Film entity architecture + DB + GraphQL + component specs

**Files:** `docs/architecture/Library-Scan/02-Film-Entity.md` (NEW), `docs/architecture/Library-Scan/README.md`, `docs/server/DB-Schema/00-Tables.md`, `docs/server/GraphQL-Schema/00-Surface.md`, `docs/client/Components/FilmVariants.md` (NEW), `docs/client/Components/FilmDetailsOverlay.md`, `docs/client/Components/Library.md`, `docs/client/Components/README.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`
**Why:** Curator sync for feat/library-film-entity branch (code landed uncommitted): Added Film logical-dedup entity for movies with 1+ video copies. Documented dedup keys (imdb_id, parsed_title_key), scanner three-pass flow, role semantics, watchlist/progress linking, GraphQL Film type + mutations, and new FilmVariants component spec.

---

## (current HEAD) — 2026-05-03 — AppHeader spec refinement: spinHoldover + mutationPending

**Files:** `docs/client/Components/AppHeader.md`
**Why:** Spec clarification after code change landed. The scan button spin is now driven by `mutationPending || spinHoldover` (2s click-triggered holdover); prior spec entry incorrectly said mutation-only with no holdover. Updated both the detailed behaviour section and the Scan Button subsection to document the combined state machine.

---

## b594485 — 2026-05-03

**Files:** `docs/client/Components/AppHeader.md`, `docs/client/Components/FilmDetailsOverlay.md`, `docs/client/Components/VideoArea.md`
**Why:** Spec curation after four bug-fix PRs: AppHeader scan button now wires GraphQL mutation (not 2s timeout); FilmDetailsOverlay prefers OMDb title; VideoArea poster unmounts on play (not opacity-fade) and topbar has no status badge.

---

## 29b5c41 — 2026-05-03

**Files:** `docs/architecture/Streaming/06-FfmpegPool.md`, `docs/server/FFmpeg-Caveats/00-Overview.md`
**Why:** Pool permit moved into `LivePid` and released on kill, not at reap. Decouples "slot claimed" from "kernel reaped child" so post-seek transcode requests don't hit `CAPACITY_EXHAUSTED` during zombie grace window.

---

## fc6fda9 — 2026-05-03 (final)

**Files:** `docs/server/FFmpeg-Caveats/00-Overview.md`, `docs/server/FFmpeg-Caveats/01-Negative-DTS.md`, `docs/server/FFmpeg-Caveats/02-Tfdt-Sample-Mismatch.md`, `docs/server/FFmpeg-Caveats/README.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, `server-rust/src/services/fmp4_tail_reader.rs`, `server-rust/src/services/mod.rs`, `server-rust/src/services/ffmpeg_file.rs`, `server-rust/src/services/chunker.rs`
**Why:** FFmpeg negative-DTS and tfdt-mismatch bugs are both fixed by dropping HLS muxer for direct `-f mp4 + tail-reader`. The `-bf 0` interim workaround is removed; B-frames re-enabled. New `02-Tfdt-Sample-Mismatch.md` documents the deeper bug (elst empty-edit causes fragment tfdt to disagree with first-sample DTS by 504 ticks; offset accumulates and kills playback at 2–5 s). E2E verified: Furiosa 4K plays cleanly to 41.97 s buffered_end=74 s.

## (pending) — 2026-05-03

**Files:** `docs/SUMMARY.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/release/README.md`, `docs/client/Components/README.md`, `docs/design/README.md`, `docs/design/UI-Design-Spec/README.md`, `.claude/agents/migrations-lead.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/Commit.md`, `docs/History.md`
**Why:** Curator pass after release-design migration retirement: promoted per-component specs from `docs/migrations/release-design/Components/` to `docs/client/Components/`; created `docs/release/Outstanding-Work.md` for post-redesign work; purged Moran/Prerelease framing from active docs; updated migrations-lead agent scope to own `design/Release/` + `docs/client/Components/`; added Commit.md and History.md entries

---

## 6a875fd — 2026-05-03 (corrected)

**Files:** `docs/architecture/Relay/00-Fragment-Contract.md`, `docs/code-style/Client-Conventions/00-Patterns.md`
**Why:** User preference is declarative-first React-Relay (no imperative store manipulation). Rewrote "Mutations and cache invalidation" to recommend `fetchPolicy: "store-and-network"` on destination query instead of `updater: store.invalidateStore()`. Mutation just commits + navigates. Moved old pattern to historical note. Code now shows CreateProfilePage.tsx (slim mutation) + HomePageContent.tsx pattern.

---

## 2026-05-03 — M8 Settings section-tab Relay exception

**Files:** `docs/code-style/Client-Conventions/00-Patterns.md`, `docs/SUMMARY.md`
**Why:** M8 Settings ships `TraceHistoryTab` with its own `useLazyLoadQuery` to avoid fetching playback history on other Settings sections; documented exception to "pages-only" rule + updated SUMMARY.md pointer

---

## 2026-05-03 — storybook testing policy (console.error, play assertions, resolver patterns)

**Files:** `docs/code-style/Client-Conventions/01-Storybook-Testing.md` (new), `docs/code-style/Client-Conventions/README.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`
**Why:** documented three CI-enforced storybook testing invariants after client/.storybook/vitest.setup.ts hardening: (1) every story must assert on real content via play function, (2) console.error during render fails tests (opt-out via parameters.expectConsoleErrors), (3) Relay resolvers must be path-aware to avoid edge-node dedup collisions

---

## 5749b76 — 2026-05-03 (boot-pack reorg + Principles/Tooling sub-trees + History.md)

**Files:** `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/SUMMARY.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, `docs/code-style/README.md`, `docs/code-style/Principles/README.md`, `docs/code-style/Principles/00-Fix-Root-Causes.md`, `docs/code-style/Principles/01-Safety-Timeouts.md`, `docs/code-style/Tooling/README.md`, `docs/code-style/Tooling/00-Linting-And-Formatting.md`, `docs/History.md`, `.claude/agents/architect.md`
**Why:** removed inline content from CLAUDE.md (engineering principles, code-quality tooling, observability rules) — replaced with one-line pointers and an upgraded Session-start directive that names the boot pack explicitly. Two new sub-trees: `code-style/Principles/` (fix-root-causes + safety-timeouts now have a canonical home) and `code-style/Tooling/` (linting + formatting per language: Rust, TS/React, SQL). New `docs/History.md` is a narrative log paired with `Commit.md` — Commit.md answers *did the docs sync at this SHA*, History.md answers *what's been changing and why*. Architect prompt updated with the pairing protocol. Added INDEX rows for all new files. Curator step (this entry + INDEX rows + History.md bootstrap) was performed by the main agent because the architect notification produced a fabricated report.

## 38ed25d — 2026-05-03 (M6 relay-compiler operation-naming rule promotion + page-story convention)

**Files:** `docs/code-style/Invariants/00-Never-Violate.md`, `docs/code-style/Client-Conventions/00-Patterns.md`, `docs/SUMMARY.md`
**Why:** M6 (Watchlist) exposed relay-compiler operation-naming violation (M5 `DetailPaneEdit.tsx` with operations named `DetailPaneSearchQuery` / `DetailPaneMatchMutation` halted project-wide artifact generation silently); promoted to invariant #14 with explicit blast-radius call-out; added page-story convention to Client-Conventions (pages can't use `@relay_test_operation`, no storybook precedent); updated SUMMARY.md invariants shortlist to #10 (relay ops) + renumbered error-swallowing to #15

---

## 3733748 — 2026-05-02 (client-side `.utils.ts` convention — new code-style bullet)

**Files:** `docs/code-style/Client-Conventions/00-Patterns.md`
**Why:** codified rule that `*.tsx` files house only React components, props, fragments, mutations, queries; constants/formatters/type aliases/helper functions move to colocated `ComponentName.utils.ts`; applied refactor sweep to DetailPane + HomePageContent per user review direction on PR #51

---

## 931c982 — 2026-05-02 (release-design M0 INDEX row for Plan.md)

**Files:** `docs/INDEX.md`
**Why:** added retrieval row for `docs/migrations/release-design/Plan.md` (agent-orchestration scaffold for M0–M10 milestones) per migrations-lead notification; Schema-Changes.md and Porting-Guide.md are navigation-discoverable from Plan.md, no separate rows needed; SUMMARY.md unchanged (M0 is scaffolding, not architecture-level)

---

## ac4c7fd — 2026-05-02 (forward note for Rust Step 2/3 nativeResolution field)

**Files:** `docs/server/GraphQL-Schema/00-Surface.md`
**Why:** forward-note added for upcoming `Video.nativeResolution: Resolution!` field; tracks `06-File-Handling-Layer.md` §5 contract on DB column nullability and ladder-rung mapping

---

## ac4c7fd — 2026-05-02 (icon library standardisation)

**Files:** `docs/code-style/Client-Conventions/00-Patterns.md`
**Why:** curator update — both workspaces (design/Release lab + production client) standardised on @heroicons/react@1.0.6 replacing hand-rolled SVG icons; added icon sourcing convention + Figma kit link to client docs

---

## f75e3ca — 2026-05-01

**Files:** `docs/INDEX.md`
**Why:** added INDEX row for the release-design redesign cross-cutting diff per migrations-lead notification after PR #46 landed

---

## 92da4bc — 2026-05-01 (PR #46 release-design Griffel sweep + poster offline cache)

**Files:** release-design component specs (DetailPane, Poster, Library, Player, Settings, Goodbye, NotFound, Profiles)
**Why:** PR #46 Griffel sweep — added `.styles.ts` to 7 lab files and removed stale "inline styles only" TODO entries; updated Poster API note (geometry now caller-supplied via className, style prop dropped); Profiles row-internals inline TODO removed (covered by sweep)

---

## 92da4bc — 2026-05-01

**Files:** no doc updates needed
**Why:** sync scan — `874c246` ports library scanner to Rust (rust-rewrite migration in-flight under migrations-lead ownership, no architect action); `92da4bc` scaffolds design/Release/ lab + release-design redesign (INDEX rows already landed in prior session)
**Source commits scanned:** `ae702ab..92da4bc`

---

## ae702ab — 2026-05-01 (release-design migration INDEX rows)

**Files:** `docs/INDEX.md`
**Why:** added two retrieval rows for the release-design migration sub-tree (README + AppHeader spec) forwarded from migrations-lead — no SUMMARY.md update needed per migrations-lead sign-off

---

## ae702ab — 2026-05-01 (design-lab mprocs + port assignment)

**Files:** `design/mprocs.yaml` (new), `design/Release/vite.config.ts`, `design/Release/README.md`, `docs/design/UI-Design-Spec/00-Tokens-And-Layout.md`, `docs/design/UI-Design-Spec/README.md`
**Why:** mprocs added to `design/` so the lab boots from the repo root; port `5001` assigned to the design lab; doc port references updated to match — no structural doc additions needed

---

## ae702ab — 2026-05-01

**Files:** `docs/design/UI-Design-Spec/00-Tokens-And-Layout.md`, `docs/design/UI-Design-Spec/README.md`, `docs/SUMMARY.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, `.claude/skills/implement-design/SKILL.md`
**Why:** design-lab spec landed at `design/Release/`; doc index + retrieval rows updated accordingly
**Source commits scanned:** `8534bc2..ae702ab`

---

## 8534bc2 — 2026-05-01

**Files:** `docs/Commit.md` (new file — bootstrap entry, preamble-only prior to this session)
**Why:** initial bootstrap — no prior log; first-run case triggered by notification of new Commit.md file landing on main
