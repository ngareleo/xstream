# xstream — 30-Second Orientation

**This is the shared orientation every agent should read before starting a task in xstream.** It is the shortest coherent picture of the project. Everything below links into the deeper knowledge base — if you need more, route through the `architect` subagent or read the concept folder's `README.md`.

## What is xstream

High-resolution media streaming. A Rust server transcodes local video files to fMP4 segments with ffmpeg and streams them over HTTP as length-prefixed binary chunks; a React client renders them via Media Source Extensions. The Rust server runs **in-process** inside a Tauri desktop bundle for Linux, Windows, and macOS — see [`architecture/Deployment/`](architecture/Deployment/README.md). Current phase: 4K / 1080p playback with a full 240p → 4K resolution ladder.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Server runtime | Rust + tokio |
| HTTP + WS | `axum` + `tower` + `async-graphql` (`graphql-ws` subprotocol) |
| DB | `rusqlite` (bundled, WAL mode, foreign keys ON) — raw SQL only, no ORM |
| Video | `tokio::process::Command` spawning the bundled jellyfin-ffmpeg (`scripts/ffmpeg-manifest.json`, per-platform SHA256). VAAPI on Linux; macOS (VideoToolbox) and Windows (D3D11VA / QSV) paths stubbed. |
| Desktop shell | Tauri v2 — system WebView (WebKit on macOS / Linux, WebView2 on Windows); the Rust server runs as a tokio task in the same process |
| Client bundler | Rsbuild (run via `bun run`) |
| UI | React 18 + React Router v6 |
| Styles | `@griffel/react` — atomic CSS-in-JS |
| Data fetching | `react-relay` + `relay-compiler` |
| Events | `@nova/react` + `@nova/types` |

## Load-bearing invariants (the "never violate" shortlist)

Full list: [`code-style/Invariants/00-Never-Violate.md`](code-style/Invariants/00-Never-Violate.md).

1. **All SQL goes through `server-rust/src/db/queries/`** — no ad-hoc `prepare()` elsewhere.
2. **Init segment is the first frame on every new stream.** Broken order = decoder can't initialise.
3. **`SourceBuffer.appendBuffer()` must never run while `updating === true`.** Always `await waitForUpdateEnd()` first.
4. **`MediaSource.endOfStream()` fires when streaming finishes.** Skipping it stalls `<video>`.
5. **`content_fingerprint` is `NOT NULL`.** Old DBs without it must be deleted and regenerated.
6. **Relay global IDs must be URL-encoded in route links.** They're base64 and contain `/`, `+`, `=`.
7. **One resolver owns each GraphQL field.** async-graphql merges via a single `Object` impl per type; duplicate field methods will not compile, but type-name collisions across the schema would silently overwrite.
8. **Playback-path resolvers return a typed union for known failure modes — never throw a plain error.** `start_transcode` returns `StartTranscodeResult = TranscodeJob | PlaybackError`. Mid-job failures must set `ActiveJob.error_code` before notifying subscribers. See invariant #11 in `code-style/Invariants/00-Never-Violate.md`.
9. **The network stream is a pull sink, not a push source.** `routes/stream.rs` uses `axum::Body::from_stream` over an `mpsc::Receiver` — one segment per consumer demand, no internal loop. See invariant #12 in `code-style/Invariants/00-Never-Violate.md`.
10. **Never swallow errors.** No `expect`/`unwrap`/silent-discard in production Rust code; every fallible path returns `Result`; mutex poisoning is a typed error; resolver errors land in Seq with the request TraceId via the `ErrorLogger` async-graphql extension. See invariant #14 in `code-style/Invariants/00-Never-Violate.md`. Mirrored at the migration level by *tests travel with the port* — the unhappy path is part of the spec at compile/test time AND at runtime.

## Streaming pipeline in one paragraph

The client drives transcoding in **300-second chunks** (steady-state), with a shorter **30-second first chunk** (`clientConfig.playback.firstChunkDurationS`) after Play and after a Seek to cut time-to-first-frame. **Exception:** when `startS === 0` (cold start, MSE recovery at `currentTime < 300`, or seek-to-0) the controller forces `clientConfig.playback.chunkDurationS` (300 s) to avoid a VAAPI HDR silent-zero-output bug (`-ss 0 -t 30` exits cleanly with `segment_count: 0`); see `docs/server/Hardware-Acceleration/01-HDR-Pad-Artifact.md` § "VAAPI silent-success failures". All client tunables now live in a single `clientConfig` object — see [`client/Config/00-ClientConfig.md`](client/Config/00-ClientConfig.md). For each chunk, `BufferManager.init` and the `startTranscode(videoId, resolution, start, end)` mutation fire **in parallel** at boot (via `Promise.all`) so ffmpeg's cold-start overlaps the MSE `sourceopen` handshake. The mutation returns `StartTranscodeResult` (either a `TranscodeJob` on success or a typed `PlaybackError` on known failure) → the Rust server spawns a dedicated ffmpeg process producing fMP4 segments into `tmp/segments-rust/<jobId>/` (dev) or `app_cache_dir/segments/<jobId>/` (Tauri). Client then opens `GET /stream/<jobId>` — server sends `init.mp4` first (4-byte BE length + bytes), then each `segment_NNNN.m4s` as it appears. The stream endpoint uses `axum::Body::from_stream` over an `mpsc::Receiver` — one segment per consumer demand, demand-driven with no internal loop or hidden queue. Client's `BufferManager` queues-and-appends segments into the MSE `SourceBuffer`. Because the first chunk is only 30 s, a RAF prefetch fires the *next* chunk's mutation almost immediately (threshold: `chunkEnd − 90 s`, which is negative on the first chunk) and **opens its stream immediately** (lookahead slot of `ChunkPipeline`), so chunks stitch seamlessly. `chunkPipeline.drainAndDispatch` awaits `buffer.waitIfPaused()` between iterations to cooperate with backpressure (`clientConfig.buffer.forwardTargetS: 60s` / resume `20s`); the server's 180 s idle timeout is an intentional safety — never weaken it. If Chrome silently detaches the `SourceBuffer` under memory pressure or fires `endOfStream(decode_error)` from the chunk demuxer, `PlaybackController` tears down and rebuilds the MSE + pipeline at `videoEl.currentTime` directly (seek-anchored — same rationale as the seek path; budget: 3 attempts/session). Four scenarios (initial / backpressure / seek / resolution switch) have dedicated sequence diagrams in [`architecture/Streaming/01-Playback-Scenarios.md`](architecture/Streaming/01-Playback-Scenarios.md). Three load-bearing chunk-pipeline invariants — PTS contract (chunk-relative `tfdt` + `mode = "segments"` + per-chunk `sb.timestampOffset = chunkStartS`), per-chunk init re-append, lookahead segment buffering — live in [`architecture/Streaming/02-Chunk-Pipeline-Invariants.md`](architecture/Streaming/02-Chunk-Pipeline-Invariants.md); violating any one silently breaks the buffered-range timeline. The pull contract and MSE recovery are in [`architecture/Streaming/04-Demand-Driven-Streaming.md`](architecture/Streaming/04-Demand-Driven-Streaming.md).

## Engineering principles (the meta-rules)

Full rationale: [`code-style/Principles/`](code-style/Principles/README.md). The four rules:

1. **Fix root causes, not symptoms.** When a bug's cause is unknown, the plan starts with *find the cause*. Reject symptom-masks (bump the constant, force the worse fallback, special-case branch). [`code-style/Principles/00-Fix-Root-Causes.md`](code-style/Principles/00-Fix-Root-Causes.md).
2. **Don't weaken safety timeouts as a bug fix.** Timers encode intent; if a legit case looks like an abandonment, the structure is wrong, not the timer. [`code-style/Principles/01-Safety-Timeouts.md`](code-style/Principles/01-Safety-Timeouts.md).
3. **Never swallow errors.** No `expect`/`unwrap`/silent-discard in production Rust; every fallible op returns `Result`; resolver errors hit Seq with the request TraceId. [`code-style/Invariants/00-Never-Violate.md`](code-style/Invariants/00-Never-Violate.md) §14.
4. **Tests travel with the port.** When porting a subsystem, the implementation can be a rewrite; the assertions are the contract. [`code-style/Testing/00-Tests-Travel-With-The-Port.md`](code-style/Testing/00-Tests-Travel-With-The-Port.md).
